# Domain Driven Design

Focus: design of the domain model, "tackling complexity in the heart of software"

| Problem inherent      | Complexity of the domain                                      | Misunderstanding of the domain                     |
| Solution dependent    | Complexity of the domain model, architecture and technology   | Redundant Soltions, Misunderstanding of technology |

DDD supports
- understanding/defining the complexity of the domain and avoiding misunderstandings
- architectural decisions reducing the complexity of the domain model and architecture + avoiding redundant solutions

## Learning the domain from domain experts

They know...
... what they do
... how they do it
... why they do it

=> Understanding the actual state

Without deeply understanding the actual state it is impossible to define the target state

Techniques for understanding the actual state: **Event Storming** and **Domain Storytelling**
